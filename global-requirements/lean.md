# Lean Software Development

It would be very easy to wax philosophic on "Lean Software Development", though that would be unlikely to communicate the main point of what this means at Learners Guild. And other places, such as Wikipedia, [have already done a good job at that][lean-software-wikipedia].

## Lean Software Principles

What we mean by "Lean" is that, as much as is possible, we don't want to spend _any_ time working on things that are unnecessary. To us, that means following these important [principles][lean-software-principles-wikipedia] when we design / implement a piece of software:

1.	**Eliminate waste:** ruthlessly avoid bloated process, unnecessary features, context switches, and defects
2.	**Amplify learning:** software is written iteratively, with learnings from previous cycles incorporated in later ones
3.	**Decide as late as possible:** delaying decisions as much as possible until they can be made based on facts and not on uncertain assumptions and predictions
4.	**Deliver as fast as possible:** the sooner the end product is delivered without major defects, the sooner feedback can be received and incorporated into the next iteration
5.	**Empower the team:** find good people and let them do their job
6.	**Build integrity in:** refactor frequently, ensure modularity in designs, write tests
7.	**See the whole:** ensure that different modules and services work together as a cohesive whole
