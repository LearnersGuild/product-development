# Toolkit

By sharing a unified toolkit, we can collaborate more effectively.

In many cases tool choice is left to individual developers, but there are certain areas where we believe enforced consistency around predefined standard tools is a benefit worth the cost of reduced flexibility.

## Source and Version Control

We use [git][git] and [GitHub][github] for version control.

## Issue Tracking

We use [GitHub][github-projects] (which integrates with GitHub issues and PRs) to track issues, and to coordinate development.  To gain access, request an invitation from a project lead.

## Slack

You'll be automatically invited to the relevant channels in Slack. Every developer is expected to pay attention to the activity in these channels.

## Zoom

Install the [zoom][zoom] client to enable attendance to the daily morning standup as well as one-on-one sessions with an SEP.
